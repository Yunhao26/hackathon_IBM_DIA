# 🌱 LLM CO₂ Impact Estimator

**Measure, compare, and reduce the carbon footprint of Large Language Models.**

This project was developed for the **IBM Hackathon** to promote responsible and sustainable AI practices.  
It provides an intuitive way to estimate and visualize the **CO₂ impact** of different LLMs based on their usage, model size, and infrastructure parameters.

## 💡 Project Overview

As AI models become more powerful, their energy consumption and environmental impact grow significantly.  
Our solution — **LLM CO₂ Impact Estimator** — helps organizations and users understand and optimize the carbon footprint of AI systems.

The tool estimates **CO₂ emissions per inference or task**, compares multiple models, and offers actionable insights to reduce the environmental impact of AI workloads.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **CO₂ Estimation Engine:** Calculates the carbon footprint of LLM usage based on model parameters and compute data.  
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes emissions across models, datasets, and hardware configurations.  
- 🧠 **Model Comparison:** Compare the environmental performance of popular LLMs.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input model information:**  
   - Model name (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3, Falcon)  
   - Compute region and hardware type  
   - Number of tokens processed or inference duration  

2. **Calculate CO₂ emissions:**  
   - Uses energy consumption estimates and regional carbon intensity data  
   - Outputs CO₂e per task, per model

3. **Visualize and compare:**  
   - Generates comparative charts for emissions across models
